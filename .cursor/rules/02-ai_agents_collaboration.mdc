## Purpose
- Define clear rules for how Cursor (IDE), Copilot Background and automated reviewers collaborate with humans. AI accelerates, humans decide.

## Agent roles
- Cursor (IDE): complex features, architecture, UI/brand-sensitive tasks, critical bugs with local context.
- Copilot Background: mechanical, repeatable tasks (CRUD, tests, lint), ≤ 400 LOC / ≤ 20 files per PR.
- Automated Review (BugBot/Copilot): baseline QA; annotates, never auto-merges.

## Workflow
1) Issue created with scope + AC + risk/impact
2) Branch created `feature/huddle-<id>-<slug>` (or `feature/huddle-<id>-<kort-navn>`) and labeled for agent
3) Agent executes; PR opened → status Review
4) CI green + automated review + human approval(s)
5) Merge → branch auto-deleted → issue Done

## Quality controls
- Background agent requires clear AC and single-topic issues
- PR template filled (summary, changes, tests, rollback, affected areas)
- Size limits: ≤ 400 LOC / ≤ 20 files
- Tests: sufficient coverage for changed modules

## Best practices
- AI works within a defined domain (backend, CMS, UI)
- Cursor when human refinement is required; Background when deterministic
- No architecture changes without human approval
- Document AI outputs in PR (generated files, rationale)
