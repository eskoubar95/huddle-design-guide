## Flow
- Install + cache → typecheck + lint → unit tests → build → preview → integration tests.
- Deploy: Vercel (frontend/API routes) + Railway (Medusa when added).

## Gates
- `severity: error` rules gate CI (fail build/test).
- Upload Sentry sourcemaps on release.
- Run Supabase migrations in staging before production.

## Monorepo considerations
- Build `apps/web` (Next.js app) for frontend + API routes.
- Future: Build `apps/medusa` separately when added.
