## Purpose
- Define consistent branching and PR workflow so humans and AI agents follow the same flow with quality, transparency, and traceability.

## Branch naming
- Format: `{type}/huddle-{issueID}-{short-title}` (or `feature/huddle-<id>-<kort-navn>` per `03-Tech_Stack.md`)
- Examples: `feature/huddle-152-jersey-upload`, `fix/huddle-231-auction-bid-bug`, `chore/huddle-99-update-deps`
- Allowed types: `feature`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `hotfix`

## Commit conventions
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`)
- Small, meaningful commits (aim ≤ 200 LOC per commit)
- Messages describe WHAT and WHY

## Pull Request basics
- PR must include: WHAT/WHY/HOW, risks, rollback plan, test results, screenshots (if UI)
- All merges via PR; no direct commits to `main`
- Split PRs if > 400 LOC or > 20 files

## Review process
- Require green CI (lint, typecheck, tests, build)
- Automated baseline review (e.g., BugBot/Copilot) + ≥1 human approver
- High-risk (auth, payments, PII) → 2 human approvers

## Definition of Done
- Acceptance criteria met; tests updated and passing
- No TODOs or console warnings
- Docs updated (README/ADR) if architecture affected
- PR merged; branch auto-deleted; issue closed

## Branch protection
- No direct pushes to `main`
- Require green CI + review
- Auto-delete branch on merge

## CI integration (reference)
- Install + cache deps → typecheck + lint → unit tests → build → deploy preview → integration tests
