feat(dashboard): implement dynamic hero carousel with multiple slide types

WHY:
- HeroSpotlight was static and didn't show user-relevant or admin-controlled content
- Need dynamic carousel that displays different slide types based on user data and admin control
- Inspired by Sorare's approach with shifting rectangles and dynamic content

HOW:
- Created HeroCarousel component with Embla Carousel and Fade animation plugin
- Implemented 6 slide types:
  * UserStatsSlide - Shows user's wardrobe stats (jerseys, for sale, auctions)
  * UploadEncouragementSlide - Encourages users with empty wardrobe to upload
  * AuctionSlide - Featured auction with countdown timer (env var controlled)
  * JerseySlide - Recommended jersey from followed users (Collector Card design)
  * SaleSlide - Featured sale listing (env var controlled)
  * WelcomeSlide - Fallback slide when no data available
- Added HeroNavigation component (arrows + dots) with fade transitions
- Created data fetching hooks:
  * useHeroSlides - Aggregates and prioritizes all slides
  * useUserStats - Fetches user wardrobe statistics
  * useFeaturedAuction - Fetches featured auction (placeholder)
  * useFeaturedSale - Fetches featured sale (placeholder)
  * useRecommendedJersey - Recommendation algorithm (placeholder)
- Integrated fade animation (no slide-out, smooth fade transitions)
- Responsive design from mobile (500px height) to 27"+ screens
- Replaced HeroSpotlight with HeroCarousel in dashboard page
- Added embla-carousel-fade dependency

NOTES:
- Frontend implementation complete and fully functional
- Hooks currently use placeholder/test data for visualization
- Backend integration pending (see HUD-26 for hook implementation)
- Test images added: Gemini_Generated_Image_ql6m56ql6m56ql6m.png, JW_FCK_1.jpg, hero-slide-bg-2.jpg
- Collector Card design with tier system (Gold/Silver/Bronze) based on condition
- Navigation stays visible during transitions for better UX
