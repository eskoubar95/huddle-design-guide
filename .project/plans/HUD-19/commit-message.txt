fix(auth): implement email verification flow and SSO buttons

WHY:
- Users could not complete sign up after receiving verification email
- No UI existed to input 6-digit verification code
- Users were not created in Clerk Dashboard until email verified
- SSO buttons were missing from custom auth page

HOW:
- Added verification state management (isVerifying, verificationCode, isResending, resendCooldown)
- Implemented verification code input UI using InputOTP component
- Added handleVerification() to process code via attemptEmailAddressVerification()
- Added handleResendCode() with 60s cooldown and loading states
- Improved error handling with specific messages for invalid/expired codes
- Added accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Implemented SSO buttons (Google, Facebook, Discord) for login and sign up
- Created SSO callback route (/auth/sso-callback) using AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback
- Configured ClerkProvider with signInUrl/signUpUrl to use custom auth page
- Added Clerk CAPTCHA element to remove console warnings
- Added Sentry error capture for production monitoring

NOTES:
- SSO providers bypass email verification (pre-verified)
- Email verification is required only for email/password sign up
- Redirect to dashboard after successful verification (ready for onboarding integration)
- All automated and manual tests passed
